Tactic is a small Scheme like langauge in one file.

** Syntax

Instead of parenthesis Tactic use brackets. Characters and strings are
delimited by the usual single and double quotes. Quoted (literal) list
are lists that begin with a leading l, quasiquoted list begin with a
leading q, and unquoted expressions begin with a leading $. Lambdas
begin with a leading ^. The idenity function has the following form:

#+begin_src text
  ^[x x]
#+end_src


A function is a list that's car is the formal parameter list and the
cdr is the body, when the formal parameters is a list the function
takes multiple arguments:

#+begin_src text
^[[a b] [fn a b]]
#+end_src


Here are some valid Tactic definitions:

#+begin_src text
  [def a 1]
  [def b 2]
  [def c ^[[a b] [cat a b]]]
  [def d l[1 2 3]]
  [def e q[$a $b 3]]
  [def f ^[x [pow x 5]]
  [def g 'c']
  [def h "hello"]
  [def i 3.14]
#+end_src
